**Key points:**

- Our goal is to maximasing the probability and minimising the cross-entropy. Cross-entropy is inversely proportional to the total probability of an outcome.
- Multi-class cross-entropy formula
- Error Function formula

- If a point is well classified, we will get a small gradient. And if it's poorly classified, the gradient will be quite large.
